# Wisdon - Personal Management Software

Interface for my software for management of personal finances.
I'm wondering about using Firebase as the back-end for this version.

#### Note
I'm using [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/) as design system.

## Installation

Clone the repository and then install dependencies thru your preferable package manager. I recommend you to use yarn.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

To run the application execute
```bash
yarn start
```

To run an optimized bundle to deploy execute
```bash
yarn build
```

## Checking
When server is running you can access the app typing http://localhost:3000 on your browser.
